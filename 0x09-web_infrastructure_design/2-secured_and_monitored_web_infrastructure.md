# Description:
This infrastructure comprises three servers designed to be secure, monitored, and capable of serving encrypted traffic.

# Specifics About This Infrastructure:

* Purpose of Firewalls:
Firewalls serve as protective barriers, safeguarding the network, particularly the web servers, against unauthorized access. Acting as intermediaries between the internal and external networks, they block incoming traffic that doesn't meet predefined criteria, thereby enhancing security.

* Purpose of SSL Certificates:
SSL certificates play a crucial role in encrypting traffic between the web servers and external networks. By encrypting data, they thwart potential man-in-the-middle attacks and prevent network sniffers from intercepting and deciphering sensitive information. SSL certificates ensure privacy, integrity, and authentication of communication channels.

* Purpose of Monitoring Clients:
Monitoring clients are deployed to oversee the performance and operations of the servers and external network. They assess server health, scrutinize performance metrics, and promptly alert administrators to any deviations from expected behavior. Monitoring tools conduct comprehensive evaluations, testing server accessibility, measuring response times, and flagging issues such as file corruption, security vulnerabilities, or other operational anomalies.

# Issues With This Infrastructure:

* SSL Termination at Load Balancer Level:
Terminating SSL at the load balancer level leaves traffic between the load balancer and web servers unencrypted, potentially exposing sensitive data. Implementing end-to-end encryption can mitigate this vulnerability.

* Single MySQL Server:
Relying on a single MySQL server poses scalability challenges and introduces a single point of failure. Scaling horizontally by deploying multiple database servers and employing techniques like replication or sharding can enhance scalability and fault tolerance.

* Uniform Component Distribution Across Servers:
Deploying servers with identical components may result in resource contention, such as CPU, memory, and I/O, leading to suboptimal performance. Additionally, troubleshooting becomes cumbersome, as identifying the source of performance issues becomes more challenging. Implementing a more diverse distribution of components and employing resource management strategies can mitigate these challenges and improve scalability and performance.
