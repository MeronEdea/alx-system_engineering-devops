# Description:
This upgraded web infrastructure represents a scaled-up version of the previous setup, aiming to eliminate all Single Points of Failure (SPOFs). Each major component, including the web server, application server, and database servers, now resides on separate GNU/Linux servers. Additionally, SSL protection isn't terminated at the load balancer, and each server's network is fortified with a firewall while being actively monitored.

# Specifics About This Infrastructure:

* Firewall Implementation Between Servers:
Introducing firewalls between each server enhances security by safeguarding against unwanted and unauthorized access. Each server is shielded individually, mitigating risks effectively.

# Issues With This Infrastructure:

* High Maintenance Costs:
While this setup bolsters security and resilience, it comes at the expense of increased maintenance costs. The deployment of separate servers for each major component necessitates the procurement of additional hardware and incurs higher electricity bills. Consequently, financial resources must be allocated for server acquisition and ongoing operational expenses, potentially straining the company's budget.
