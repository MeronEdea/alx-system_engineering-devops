# Description:
This setup constitutes a straightforward web infrastructure hosting a website accessible via www.foobar.com. Notably, there are no sophisticated security measures such as firewalls or SSL certificates in place, and each component, including the database and application server, shares the resources provided by the server.

# Specifics About This Infrastructure:

* Server Definition:
A server serves as both the hardware and software that delivers services to other computers, commonly known as clients.

* Domain Name's Role:
The domain name acts as a user-friendly alias for an IP address, enhancing accessibility and memorability. DNS maps the domain name to its associated IP address.

* Type of DNS Record for www.foobar.com:
www.foobar.com employs an A record, as verified through DNS lookup. This record type establishes the correspondence between hostnames and IPv4 addresses.

* Web Server's Role:
The web server is integral, as it handles HTTP or HTTPS requests and furnishes requested resources or error messages.

* Application Server's Role:
The application server takes charge of deploying, managing, and hosting applications and services for users, organizations, or IT services, ensuring the efficient delivery of consumer or business applications.

* Database's Role:
The database serves as a structured repository for organized information, facilitating easy access, management, and updates.

* Server-Client Communication:
Communication between the server and the client's computer transpires over the internet via the TCP/IP protocol suite.

# Issues With This Infrastructure:

* Single Points of Failure (SPOF):
This infrastructure harbors multiple SPOFs. For instance, if the MySQL database server experiences downtime, the entire website becomes inaccessible.

* Downtime During Maintenance:
Maintenance tasks necessitate component shutdowns or server downtime, given the absence of redundancy. Consequently, the website experiences interruptions.

* Scalability Challenges:
Scalability is hindered by the consolidated nature of the infrastructure. The singular server configuration limits resource availability and can impede performance during high traffic influxes.
